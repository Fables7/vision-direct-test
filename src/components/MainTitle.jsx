        How to read your contact lens prescription

      <p>
        Your contact lens prescription allows you to purchase contact lenses
        that match your requirements from opticians or online suppliers. You
        should always be given a prescription after a successful contact lens
        fitting. If you didn’t receive one, in the UK it’s your legal right to
        have a copy, so just reach out to your optician and ask.
